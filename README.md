# React Enterprise Demo
#### Enterprise Level and Industry Standard

##### Purspose:
To capture the look and feel of the UI I've been working on in AROYA for the last 1.5 years, I built this demo app following *Ed Roh's* [react-admin-dashboard](https://github.com/ed-roh/react-admin-dashboard) tutorial. Leveraging enterprise level dependencies, this app includes a css grid dashboard, nivo charts, material ui tables, & a formik/yup form.

---

##### Theme:
I wanted to set up a theme similar to what I was using in AROYA and switch between light and dark mode. Theme was created with Material IU and context was created with React Context. Used Tailwind Shades to create the object of shade vlaues given a hex color. This made for very convenient set up of reusable styles. 

##### Dependencies:
- Material Ui/Icons/X Data Grid
- React Pro Sidebar
- React Router Dom
- FullCalendar
- Nivo
- Formik
- yup
